Picobeats
====

This is a [SEGA Flashbeats](https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=17932) inspired minigame for the raspberry pi pico, pimoroni picounicorn, and something to make some sound...

Requirements
----

You'll need Pimoroni's picounicorn module to run this.  As of this writing, the easiest way is to flash their micropython .uf2 file for your Pico.

Gameplay
----

There should be a goal, and I'll consider updating this when I add one.
